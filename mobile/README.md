# Core module for aquila light wallets.

This is a java wrapper library for AQX. Share common AQX code between different apps/projects to prevent WET code and make things more DRY. Mainly in the context of light wallets. In the future this could be extended to a full implementation of AQX node in java. But as this would be a huge endeavour and have many things in the route map already don't expect it in the near future - but PRs are accepted ;-)
